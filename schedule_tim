		Converting Bins compatible to PMMLTranslator   							100%
		Implement PMMLModel to Node									100%
		Improve View and using SettingsModelColumnFilter2						100%
		Implenting executive procedure
			Reading in and checking all Settings							100%
			Creating right Specs for statistic table						100%
			
KW 5 
		Problems using SettingsModelColumnFilter2 - no access to selected columns			100%
		Generating Bins											100%
		Writing information (parameter, bin_total, bin_1..n) in tables					100%
		handing over converted PMML bins 								100%
	

KW 6
		Solved problems with ColumnFilter (Still no excluding List)					80%
		Problem with random input data - cell creating is not yet working				 0%
		issues with settings, ex.: number of bins not working						10%
		Problem with PMML Port - handing over not all bins						100% - YEEEEAH
		Creating new Node: Binning QC									 10%
			Ports: 	input -> input data (table), pmml
				output -> new table, pmml?
			Features:
				reading in bins out of pmml port
				calculate p-value for each sel. column with imported bin intervals
				evaluates plausibility of sel. columns with p-Value
				option to delete columns within a selected threshold of the p-Value



KW 7
		 
		Checking if possible to handover statistic with PMML						0%
		Create second table with statistically relevant information	Amount of Bins			0%
										p-Value (Antje take care)
										
		using Interval table #36					using existing IntervallCell
		
	
Steps ToDo

BinningCalculate

- Changing titles of column to 10%â€¦
- using right label and right position of bin, in case theres is only a bin for 20%...
- PMML Model
	- needs to have the right data type showing in the PMML Model
- What kind of error handling?
	- not compatble to all kind of tables - table cell creating still causes errors
	- describing what kind of data i need and how can i help the user 
- Issues in Dialogue
	- DialogComponentColumnFilter2
		- excluded columns does not work -  it is not affecting the tablespecs
	- Issue with saving or reading in node settings - need to find out whats the problem 
- Writing all descriptions and specifications

BinningQC

- Reading in PMML Model
- Creating table layout like
		Group1  Group2  Group3 parameter1 parameter2 parameter3
- using dialogue component like in GroupBy
- PMML outPort with PMML inPort
- Calculating the p-Value
- Writing all descriptions and specifications

Deploying
- checking all descriptions 
- check code documentation
- creating test workflows and check node with checklist

Example from Antje in R: 

binCounts <- c(2486,1653,1897,1879,2085)
#binCounts <- c(2034,1945,2001,1923,1932)
binPercent <- binCounts / sum(binCounts)
binExpect <- rep(0.2,5)

testStat <- chisq.test(binCounts, p=binExpect)
testStat$p.value

testStat <- chisq.test(binPercent, p=binExpect)
testStat$p.value

testStat <- chisq.test(binPercent*100, p=binExpect)
testStat$p.value

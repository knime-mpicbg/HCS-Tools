General:
There is a new version of the PlateViewer node with additional functionality.

HCS Tools
-   new HeatmapViewerNode
    novel functionality:
        - Supports more predefined colormaps as well a new editor to create custom colormaps.
        - The Options menu is migrated to the menubar for consistency with other KNIME views.
        - Support of the HiLite functionality of KNIME.
        - Mouse drag selection is supported in the ScreenViewer (selecting plates) and the PlateViewer (selecting wells).  If at least one Well is selected of the plate, the entire plate is colored as selected in the heat map trellis.
        - The KNIME color model can be selected as overlay in the overlay-popupmenu.
        - Image support. Images are displayed in the WellViewer.
        - Extended plate sorting functionality (sort according to several plate attributes)
        - The heatmap trellis allows to fix the plate proportions and it's row and column number can also be fixed manually.
    minor changes:
        - The "Highlight Selection" option was renamed "Mark Selection" to avoid confusion with the HiLite mechanism of KNIME
        - Detail views are called with the right click (could not figure a way to avoid conflicts between the double click and the drag selection. besides now calling a details view does not affect the selection anymore).
        - Toolbars can be hidden
        - The main window has some control over it's child window (bring to front, close all).
        - The colormap can be scaled for each window seperatly or for each Screen/PlateViewer seperatly (global color scale)
-   new package "heatmap". It contains the UI implementation of for the HeatMapViewerNodeView. The ScreenExplorer node still has the view implementation in the hcscore plugin.
    The UI from the ScreenExplorer was used as basis, but the new heatmap package finally ended up with new implementations of the "-Viewer classes". The most conserved classes are now in the renderer sub-package. Everything was refactored though and documentation was added.

hcscore
-   in the model package the Plate and Well class were extende to accomodate the handling of image data. Additionally there are two new classes defining the plate attributes and another providing the sorting algorithms for the plate attributes.
-   some experimental/in progress classes were moved to the "experimental" package.


knutils
- The Attribute and AttributeUtils classes were extended to handle image data
